# pvPerks
This plugin is designed to replace cosmetic perks from Essentials such colours and formatting on signs as well as features from other plugins used regularly on [Purity Vanilla](https://www.purityvanilla.com/).

This plugin depends on [pvCore]("https://github.com/chiralpenguin/pvCore") for data storage and other centralised features.
